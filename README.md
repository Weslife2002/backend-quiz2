There are two files named main.js and subMain.js.

For the main.js file, I try to minimize the usage of moment.js library as much as possible, so that I could understand what is actually under the hood. However, It is better to use moment.js as the code is more optimized than doing it myself.

For the subMain.js file, It is the file that I use moment.js to do the same thing. In real project, I would opt for this approach for the sake of simplicity, accuracy and speed.
